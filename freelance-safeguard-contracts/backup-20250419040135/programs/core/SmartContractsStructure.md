# FreelanceShield Core Program

A comprehensive Solana/Anchor program for freelance insurance management on the Solana blockchain, designed specifically for the unique risks faced by freelancers and clients in digital work environments.

## Overview

The FreelanceShield Core Program provides an end-to-end insurance solution that handles all aspects of freelance work protection:

- Insurance product management for various freelance scenarios
- Policy issuance with customizable coverage terms
- Claims processing with decentralized verification
- Risk pool management with dynamic premium calculations
- Capital provider incentives and reward distribution

## FreelanceShield Protocol Architecture

The FreelanceShield protocol consists of multiple specialized programs that work together as a comprehensive ecosystem:

```
freelance-safeguard-contracts/
├── programs/
│   ├── core/                    # Central coordinator program
│   ├── risk-pool-program/       # Capital and risk management
│   ├── staking-program/         # Token staking and rewards
│   ├── claims-processor/        # Claim verification and processing
│   ├── policy-nft/              # Policy tokenization as NFTs
│   ├── reputation-program/      # On-chain reputation tracking
│   ├── dao-governance/          # Decentralized governance
│   ├── escrow-program/          # Secure fund management
│   ├── enhanced-cover/          # Premium insurance options
│   ├── enhanced-claims/         # Advanced claims processing
│   └── enhanced-risk-pool/      # Extended risk management
```

While each program handles specific functionality in depth, the Core Program serves as a central entry point for many common operations, simplifying user interactions with the protocol.

### Program Interactions

- **Core ↔ Risk Pool**: Core calls Risk Pool to manage capital reserves and risk calculations
- **Core ↔ Policy NFT**: Core initiates policy NFT minting when policies are created
- **Core ↔ Claims Processor**: Core forwards claim submissions to the specialized processor
- **Risk Pool ↔ Staking**: Risk Pool distributes rewards to stakers based on capital contribution
- **Claims Processor ↔ Reputation**: Claims outcomes affect user reputation scores
- **All Programs ↔ DAO Governance**: Protocol parameters can be updated via governance

## Core Program Structure

The core program itself is structured as follows:

```
