# FreelanceShield Technical Architecture

## Overview
FreelanceShield is a revolutionary decentralized insurance protocol built on Solana using the Anchor framework. Designed specifically for the freelance economy, it provides robust risk management, transparent claims processing, and community-driven governance.

## Core Principles
1. **Decentralization**: Fully on-chain operations with no single point of failure
2. **Transparency**: All operations and decisions are verifiable on the blockchain
3. **Efficiency**: Leveraging Solana's high throughput and low fees
4. **Security**: Comprehensive smart contract protections and risk management
5. **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making through token voting
