# FreelanceShield System Architecture

## Overview

FreelanceShield is a comprehensive decentralized insurance protocol built on Solana blockchain, specifically designed to protect freelancers against common risks in their professional activities. The protocol leverages Solana's high-performance capabilities to provide affordable, transparent, and efficient insurance services with minimal overhead costs.

This document provides a detailed architecture overview of the entire FreelanceShield ecosystem, including on-chain programs, state management, cross-program interactions, frontend integration, and governance mechanisms.

## Core Design Principles

FreelanceShield's architecture adheres to the following fundamental principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is composed of specialized programs that perform specific functions while communicating through secure cross-program invocations.

2. **Decentralization**: All core functionality operates on-chain with transparent rules and governance, eliminating centralized points of control.

3. **Security-First**: Multiple layers of security controls, access permissions, and validation checks protect user funds and protocol integrity.

4. **Efficiency**: Smart contract design is optimized for Solana's computational model, minimizing transaction costs while maintaining high throughput.

5. **Upgradability**: Programs implement secure upgrade mechanisms to allow for protocol evolution while preserving user assets and state.

6. **Reputation-Based**: The protocol incorporates a Bayesian reputation system that drives risk assessment and incentivizes positive behavior.

## Cross-Program Interactions

FreelanceShield programs communicate through secure cross-program invocations (CPIs) to maintain a modular architecture while ensuring data consistency.

### Key CPI Flows

1. **Policy Purchase Flow**:
   ```
   User -> Core Program (purchase_policy)
     -> Risk Pool Program (allocate_capital)
     -> Reputation Program (record_event)
   ```

2. **Claim Processing Flow**:
   ```
   User -> Claims Processor (submit_claim)
     -> Core Program (validate_policy)
     -> Reputation Program (check_reputation)
     -> [Verification Process]
     -> Risk Pool Program (process_payout)
     -> Reputation Program (update_score)
   ```

3. **Policy Tokenization Flow**:
   ```
   User -> Core Program (tokenize_policy)
     -> Policy NFT Program (mint_policy_nft)
     -> [Transfer processes]
   ```

4. **Governance Execution Flow**:
   ```
   DAO Governance Program (execute_proposal)
     -> Target Program (update_parameters)
   ```

### Security Measures

All CPIs implement comprehensive security measures:

1. **Signature Verification**: Ensures that the appropriate authorities have signed transactions
2. **Program ID Validation**: Validates the calling program's identity
3. **Account Ownership Checks**: Verifies that accounts belong to the expected programs
4. **PDA Derivation Validation**: Ensures PDAs are derived with correct seeds and bumps
5. **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents malicious reentrancy attacks during state modifications

## Frontend Integration

The FreelanceShield frontend interfaces with on-chain programs through a comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.

### Key SDK Functions

```typescript
// Policy Purchase
export async function purchasePolicy(
  connection: Connection,
  wallet: Wallet,
  product: PublicKey,
  coverageAmount: number,
  durationMonths: number
): Promise<TransactionSignature> {
  // Constructs and sends purchase policy transaction
  // Handles all account creation and token transfers
  // Returns transaction signature for confirmation
}

// Claim Submission
export async function submitClaim(
  connection: Connection,
  wallet: Wallet,
  policy: PublicKey,
  amount: number,
  evidenceUri: string,
  evidenceHash: string
): Promise<TransactionSignature> {
  // Handles claim submission process
  // Creates necessary PDA accounts
  // Uploads evidence hash on-chain
  // Returns transaction signature
}
```

## User Experience Flows

### Freelancer Policy Purchase Flow

1. User connects Phantom Wallet to FreelanceShield dApp
2. User browses available insurance products
3. User selects a product and customizes coverage parameters
4. FreelanceShield SDK calculates premium based on:
   - Base premium for the product
   - User's reputation score (retrieved from Reputation Program)
   - Selected coverage amount
   - Policy duration
5. User approves the transaction in their wallet
6. SDK constructs transaction that:
   - Creates policy account via Core Program
   - Transfers premium payment to protocol treasury
   - Allocates capital from Risk Pool Program
   - Updates user's reputation via Reputation Program
7. User receives confirmation and policy details
8. Optional: User can tokenize policy into an NFT for transferability

### Claim Submission and Processing Flow

1. User with active policy connects wallet to FreelanceShield dApp
2. User initiates claim submission process
3. User provides:
   - Claim amount (within policy coverage limits)
   - Evidence documents (stored on decentralized storage)
   - Description of claim circumstances
4. SDK constructs claim submission transaction that:
   - Creates claim account via Claims Processor
   - Records evidence hash on-chain
   - Updates claim count on policy
5. Decentralized verification process begins:
   - Verifiers are assigned based on stake and reputation
   - Verifiers review evidence and submit decisions
   - Quorum-based decision mechanism determines outcome
6. If claim is approved:
   - Payout is processed from Risk Pool via CPI
   - User's reputation is updated accordingly
   - Policy status is updated to reflect claim
7. User receives notification of claim resolution

## Protocol Governance

FreelanceShield implements a decentralized governance system allowing token holders to participate in protocol decision-making.

### Governable Parameters

1. **Risk Parameters**:
   - Base premium rates for different product categories
   - Risk multipliers for reputation tiers
