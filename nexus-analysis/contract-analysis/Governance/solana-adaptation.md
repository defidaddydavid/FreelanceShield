# Solana/Anchor Adaptation for Governance

## Overview
This document outlines how to adapt the Ethereum-based Governance contract to Solana's Anchor framework.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Account Model vs. Balance Model
- Ethereum uses a balance model where state is stored in contracts
- Solana uses an account model where state is stored in separate accounts
- We'll need to create appropriate account structures for each state component

### 2. Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- Replace Ethereum's contract-to-contract calls with Solana's CPI
- Implement proper PDA (Program Derived Address) signing for authorized operations

### 3. Transaction Model
- Solana transactions have different constraints than Ethereum
- Design instructions to fit within Solana's transaction size limits
- Consider using multiple transactions for complex operations

### 4. Events and Logging
- Replace Ethereum events with Solana program logs
- Implement proper event logging for indexing and UI feedback


## Governance Adaptations

### Proposal Account Structure
```rust
#[account]
pub struct Proposal {
    pub proposer: Pubkey,
    pub description: String,
    pub start_time: i64,
    pub end_time: i64,
    pub executed: bool,
    pub votes_for: u64,
    pub votes_against: u64,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

### Create Proposal
```rust
pub fn create_proposal(
    ctx: Context<CreateProposal>,
    description: String,
    voting_period: u64,
) -> Result<()> {
    let proposal = &mut ctx.accounts.proposal;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    proposal.proposer = ctx.accounts.proposer.key();
    proposal.description = description;
    proposal.start_time = clock.unix_timestamp;
    proposal.end_time = clock.unix_timestamp + voting_period as i64;
    proposal.executed = false;
    proposal.votes_for = 0;
    proposal.votes_against = 0;
    proposal.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("proposal").unwrap();
    
    Ok(())
}
```


## Implementation Approach

1. Define account structures for all state components
2. Implement instructions corresponding to key contract functions
3. Design proper authorization using PDAs
4. Implement cross-program invocations for system interactions
5. Add comprehensive testing for all functionality
