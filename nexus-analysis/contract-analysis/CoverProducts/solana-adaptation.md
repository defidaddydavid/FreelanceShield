# Solana/Anchor Adaptation for CoverProducts

## Overview
This document outlines how to adapt the Ethereum-based CoverProducts contract to Solana's Anchor framework.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Account Model vs. Balance Model
- Ethereum uses a balance model where state is stored in contracts
- Solana uses an account model where state is stored in separate accounts
- We'll need to create appropriate account structures for each state component

### 2. Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- Replace Ethereum's contract-to-contract calls with Solana's CPI
- Implement proper PDA (Program Derived Address) signing for authorized operations

### 3. Transaction Model
- Solana transactions have different constraints than Ethereum
- Design instructions to fit within Solana's transaction size limits
- Consider using multiple transactions for complex operations

### 4. Events and Logging
- Replace Ethereum events with Solana program logs
- Implement proper event logging for indexing and UI feedback


## Insurance-Specific Adaptations

### Policy Account Structure
```rust
#[account]
pub struct Policy {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub coverage_amount: u64,
    pub premium_amount: u64,
    pub start_date: i64,
    pub end_date: i64,
    pub status: PolicyStatus,
    pub risk_score: u8,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

### Policy Creation
```rust
pub fn create_policy(
    ctx: Context<CreatePolicy>,
    coverage_amount: u64,
    period_days: u16,
) -> Result<()> {
    let policy = &mut ctx.accounts.policy;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Calculate premium
    let premium_amount = calculate_premium(
        ctx.accounts.insurance_state,
        coverage_amount,
        period_days
    );
    
    // Initialize policy
    policy.owner = ctx.accounts.owner.key();
    policy.coverage_amount = coverage_amount;
    policy.premium_amount = premium_amount;
    policy.start_date = clock.unix_timestamp;
    policy.end_date = clock.unix_timestamp + (period_days as i64 * 86400);
    policy.status = PolicyStatus::Active;
    policy.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("policy").unwrap();
    
    // Transfer premium to risk pool
    // ...
    
    Ok(())
}
```


## Implementation Approach

1. Define account structures for all state components
2. Implement instructions corresponding to key contract functions
3. Design proper authorization using PDAs
4. Implement cross-program invocations for system interactions
5. Add comprehensive testing for all functionality
