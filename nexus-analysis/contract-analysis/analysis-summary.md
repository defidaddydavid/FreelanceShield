## Solana/Anchor Adaptation Considerations

1. **Account Model**: Ethereum uses a balance model, while Solana uses an account model. We'll need to redesign state storage.

2. **Cross-Program Invocation**: Replace Ethereum's contract-to-contract calls with Solana's CPI (Cross-Program Invocation).

3. **Gas Optimization**: Solana has different fee structures, requiring optimization for compute units rather than gas.

4. **Storage Costs**: Solana charges rent for account storage, requiring careful account design.

5. **Tokenization**: Adapt Ethereum's ERC-721 NFT standards to Solana's SPL token standards.
