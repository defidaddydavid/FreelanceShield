# Solana/Anchor Adaptation for IndividualClaims

## Overview
This document outlines how to adapt the Ethereum-based IndividualClaims contract to Solana's Anchor framework.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Account Model vs. Balance Model
- Ethereum uses a balance model where state is stored in contracts
- Solana uses an account model where state is stored in separate accounts
- We'll need to create appropriate account structures for each state component

### 2. Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)
- Replace Ethereum's contract-to-contract calls with Solana's CPI
- Implement proper PDA (Program Derived Address) signing for authorized operations

### 3. Transaction Model
- Solana transactions have different constraints than Ethereum
- Design instructions to fit within Solana's transaction size limits
- Consider using multiple transactions for complex operations

### 4. Events and Logging
- Replace Ethereum events with Solana program logs
- Implement proper event logging for indexing and UI feedback


## Claims-Specific Adaptations

### Claim Account Structure
```rust
#[account]
pub struct Claim {
    pub policy: Pubkey,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub status: ClaimStatus,
    pub submission_date: i64,
    pub risk_score: u8,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

### Claim Submission
```rust
pub fn submit_claim(
    ctx: Context<SubmitClaim>,
    amount: u64,
    evidence: String,
) -> Result<()> {
    let claim = &mut ctx.accounts.claim;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Validate policy is active
    // ...
    
    // Calculate risk score
    let risk_score = calculate_risk_score(
        ctx.accounts.policy,
        amount,
        clock.unix_timestamp
    );
    
    // Initialize claim
    claim.policy = ctx.accounts.policy.key();
    claim.owner = ctx.accounts.owner.key();
    claim.amount = amount;
    claim.status = ClaimStatus::Pending;
    claim.submission_date = clock.unix_timestamp;
    claim.risk_score = risk_score;
    claim.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("claim").unwrap();
    
    Ok(())
}
```


## Implementation Approach

1. Define account structures for all state components
2. Implement instructions corresponding to key contract functions
3. Design proper authorization using PDAs
4. Implement cross-program invocations for system interactions
5. Add comprehensive testing for all functionality
