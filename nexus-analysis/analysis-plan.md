## Analysis Methodology

1. **Contract ABI and Source Code Retrieval**
   - Use Etherscan to retrieve ABIs and verified source code
   - Document contract interfaces and key functions

2. **Functional Analysis**
   - Identify core business logic in each contract
   - Map data structures and state management
   - Document event emissions and external interactions

3. **Cross-Contract Interaction Analysis**
   - Map dependencies between contracts
   - Identify permission models and access control
   - Document upgrade patterns and proxy implementations

4. **Economic Model Analysis**
   - Document premium calculation formulas
   - Analyze capital efficiency mechanisms
   - Map incentive structures for stakeholders

5. **Solana/Anchor Adaptation Planning**
   - Identify Solana-specific architectural considerations
   - Map Ethereum patterns to Anchor program design
   - Document required PDAs and account structures
