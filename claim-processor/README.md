# FreelanceShield Claims Processor

The Claims Processor is a specialized Solana program within the FreelanceShield protocol that handles insurance claim verification, fraud detection, and payout processing.

## Overview

This module is a critical component of the FreelanceShield protocol's fraud prevention system, ensuring that only legitimate claims are approved and paid out. The program leverages multiple data points and risk factors to protect the protocol and honest users from fraudulent activities.

## Features

### Fraud Detection System

The Claims Processor employs an advanced fraud detection system that:

- Analyzes claim patterns to identify suspicious activity
- Examines evidence consistency and authenticity
- Considers the claimant's history and reputation
- Identifies potential collusion between parties
- Flags suspicious timing between policy purchase and claim filing
- Evaluates claim amount against policy coverage and typical project values

### Multi-stage Verification

Claims undergo a multi-stage verification process:

1. **Initial Submission**: Claimants file claims with basic information
2. **Evidence Collection**: Both parties submit evidence to support their position
3. **Automated Fraud Detection**: System generates a fraud score and flags suspicious indicators
4. **Manual Review**: High-risk claims are routed to human verifiers for additional scrutiny
5. **Payout Processing**: Approved claims are paid from the risk pool

### Risk-Based Adjustments

The system dynamically adjusts several parameters based on risk assessment:

- Waiting periods before claims can be filed
- Coverage caps for high-risk users
- Premium adjustments based on claim history
- Evidence requirements scaled to claim amount

## Technical Architecture

### State Accounts

- **ClaimAccount**: Stores claim details, status, and fraud assessment
- **EvidenceItem**: Contains evidence hashes, metadata, and verification status
- **PolicyAccount**: Manages policy terms, coverage, and claim history
- **ClaimantHistory**: Tracks claim patterns and risk indicators for users
- **ClaimVerification**: Records verifier decisions and reasoning

### Key Instructions

- `initialize_claim`: Creates a new claim on a policy
- `add_evidence`: Adds supporting evidence to an existing claim
- `submit_claim_for_review`: Triggers fraud detection and review process
- `review_claim`: Manual verification by an authorized verifier
- `process_claim_payment`: Executes payout for approved claims

## Security Features

- Uses Solana PDAs (Program Derived Addresses) for secure account management
- Implements detailed access controls for each instruction
- Maintains cryptographic evidence hashes to prevent tampering
- Employs a bitmask system for efficiently tracking fraud indicators
- Requires minimum evidence thresholds based on claim type and amount

## Integration Points

The Claims Processor interfaces with other components of the FreelanceShield protocol:

- **Core Program**: For coordination and protocol-wide governance
- **Risk Pool Program**: To access funds for claim payouts
- **Reputation Program**: To incorporate reputation data into risk assessment
- **DAO Governance**: For setting fraud detection parameters and risk thresholds

## Development and Deployment

This module follows the FreelanceShield development standards:

- Developed using the Anchor framework on Solana
- Optimized for Solana's constraints and performance requirements
- Initial testing on Devnet before Mainnet deployment
- Strictly follows security best practices including reentrancy protection

## Usage

The Claims Processor is intended to be accessed through the FreelanceShield frontend, which provides a user-friendly interface for submitting claims, adding evidence, and tracking claim status.
